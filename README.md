## Background
1) This project is for cross-workload design space exploration of CPU.
2) First, we proposes a sample-based transfer learning algorithm for utilizing existing source knowledge. Second, we propose an ensemble learning model together with an uncertainty-driven iterative optimization method to perform accurate and robust predictions.

## Install

This project uses skopt, math, sklearn, and several basic python packages. Go check them out in requirements.txt if you don't have them locally installed.

## Usage

This is only a documentation package.

```sh
# run main() in main.python
$ python main.python
```

Major running configurations are defined in config.py
Performance metric dataset is listed in data_all_simpoint/ . For now, it only includes a demo sample record in 500.1-refrate-1.txt
